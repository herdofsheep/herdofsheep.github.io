          Software has brought a lot of new tools to visual media in a very short amount of time, 
          though the equipment and technical skills required have meant we are used to seeing 
          software aesthetics as commercial.
        </p>
        <p class="statement">
          The process of developing work with computation as an artistic medium is often a fantastical one. 
          I'm particularly interested in speculating on how software could manifest if it had continued 
          to be understood as women's work.

          We are acutely aware of how impressive and powerful software can be, but often struggle to concieve of how it 
          could be more communal, caring. I use technology to build things that are softer, more colourful and handmade
          than we are used to seeing.
