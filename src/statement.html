          Software has brought a series of new tools to visual media in a short amount of time.
          New images are appearing faster and everywhere.
          The skills required to create these images are not those we associate with visual arts. 
          They are fast developing, ever changing, and often inaccessible.
        </p>
        <p class="statement">
          The process of developing work with computation as an artistic medium is often a fantastical one.

          What if software had continued to be understood as women's work? <br>
          What if electronics were soft, rather than hard? <br>
          What is it doing to me, having my life mediated by digital worlds?
