      Digital Symbiote was my final piece for my Computational arts MA. The system is programmed microchip and circuitboard of my own design,
      which is set up to have a symbiotic relationship with a plant. The plant and digital symbiote share a biodegradable home. 
      When the plant triggers a signal in a photoelectric sensor, the microchip in the digital symbiote is programmed to respond 
      by stimulating the game of life on its LED array. The colours of the LEDs are 
      chosen to be a good spectrum for photosynthesis, and within the dark space help to sustain the plant that the digital symbiont lives with.
      If either dies, so does the other, and so the piece is a reflection on what we consider life, complex, and what collaborative relationships
      are possible.
