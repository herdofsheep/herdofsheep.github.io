      Digital Symbiote is programmed a microchip and circuitboard, 
      which is set up to have a symbiotic relationship with a plant. The plant and digital symbiote share a biodegradable home. 
      When the plant triggers a signal in a photoelectric sensor, the microchip in the digital symbiote is programmed to respond 
      by stimulating the game of life on its LED array. The colours of the LEDs are 
      optimised for photosynthesis, and within the dark space they help to sustain the plant.
      If either dies, so does the other.
