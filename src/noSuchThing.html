<!-- Draft Outline: The Perfect Fox Cannot Exist
	The fox’s eye reflects the forest. You lean in, gazing at it, carefully changing the angle as the black trees within warp and shift. It’s nearly perfect. All you need is to change the surface so that the light reflects just right, and to do that you’ll finally need to sort out that persistent weirdness with the sunlight. 
	[Fox eye image]
Through the leaves it looks fine but when you stare up into the blue sky it just doesn’t feel right. The light is too small. The sky is right, you’re sure of that: you checked through the reference images months ago, ran the atmospheric simulations, it’s the proper level of blue. Maybe it’s not big enough; at the fastest you can travel it would only take at an hour to get to it, maybe a little less. Does knowing that make it feel smaller? 
	[The sky/horizon]
	The fox melts away into the undergrowth as you quietly float along the path. You’ll fix the soil so it feels right one of these days and until then you’d prefer not to stand on it – it just wouldn’t be right. And then you see it. The clearing, the one you sat in all those years ago (although you’d fixed that tree and made it far more comfortable to sit against), should have been just that, a clearing empty save for grass and warm summer air.

	[Standing over the Tree]
	The silent invader marches on, an aberration in your perfect system, a corruption of the benign code that was meant to create leaf mulch. You wouldn’t have thought that fungi could evolve in a closed system, but it seems that some parts of nature are just meant to be. While you work it toils on, monotonously breaking down the paradise you build until there’s nothing left, weeks of progress and careful planning turned into brown sludge. 
	[Transformation sequence]
When you return, breathing the sweet air again you are greeted with a barren – no, not barren, nothing this alive could ever be called barren. Corrupted, perhaps, yes, a corrupted landscape and a universe of brown and a closed horizon perfect blue; the mountains have turned to mulch. All brown and blue, forever and ever, all lit by that same strange light.
