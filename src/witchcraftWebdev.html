        The web has a high barrier for entry, there is a lot of money in keeping the internet expensive, mysterious and inaccessible, and part of that is in the language we use to describe it. <br><br>
        In this ritual, We will be simulatenously be leaning web development 101, and using a mental framework to approach web development from an unusual perspective- using witchcraft to manifest a link for ourselves in the online web. <br><br>
        The entire exercise is free, and will end with us having a web page, which we can customise to the limits of how much code/spellcasting we are willing to learn. This is not squarespace or livejournal- everything will run on our own code, and there are no constraints to what we can do, other than what is currently possible on the internet, and 2GB of storage space (loads!).<br><br>
        I will encourage you to learn some of the 'tech' language to be able to speak in the internet's tongue, but also think of creating a website in an unconventional way.

        github is a space on the internet you may have heard of- it is largely an organisational space for a tool called 'git'. Its extremely useful, but we won't be using it in a great amount of detail here. <br><br>
        Each github account provides you with a free web domain, where we can 'host' our code, and manifest the spell we are casting- to command a space on the web, where anyone can visit and experience the web page which we have manifested. <br><br>
        We need to create a unique name for our account, which will also be the 'address' url which will be used to find our link. <br><br>
        For deciding on your url- try thinking about what it is you are hoping to manifest. Will it be a place to showcase your art? Somewhere to experiment and make work with the medium of code? A place to write down your thoughts?

        you could think about:
        <ul>
            <li>the web as an invisible entangled connection between thousands of individuals, similar to a fungal blanket connecting trees in an ancient forest.</li> <br>
            <li>the web as a word associated with spiders, capturing and entrapping data and hours of time of people, encircling the whole world.</li> <br>
            <li>the web as a social project, the effort of thousands, all contributing to an enormous collaboration. The organising of enormous amounts of complex work in a way which is trying to constantly grow and innovate, without breaking the millions of web projects which have been built since 1989.</li> <br>
            <li>
                the act of writing code (which we will think of in this workshop as 'spell writing'), the tapestry weaving of connecting logic, the feminine history of developing programming-

            We now, in order to proceed, need to confirm our email address. It is best not to take this decision lightly- github is owned by Microsoft. <br><br>
            The hierarchical accumulation of data is an important concern. Now is a good moment to try and visualise this accumulation of data, information, currency, power, concentrated in locuses like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google. <br><br>
            Remember our goal- what are we manifesting? A space in this interconnected web for ourselves, free and accessible to us and to those we share it with. Is data harvesting a price worth paying for access to this powerful online space? Perhaps think on collective responsibility, grass roots power. Perhaps you want to do a little research into this yourself.

            We now, in the words of github, create a 'repository'. We can think of this as a host to hold our spell, a location in the web, in github's information storage and (if we want) a file location on our computer simulataneously. <br><br>
            What makes it a 'repository' is the linking of these things, which makes our spell (aka our code) consistent in all of these different forms. That is essentially all that 'git' is. <br><br>
            In order for this repository to be treated as a website, it must use the free domain that you get associated with your github account as the name. For me, it is manifestation-spell.github.io. For you, it will be USERNAME-YOU-CHOSE.github.io

            An index.html is a universally understood gateway to a website. It will be understood by an 'internet browser' (firefox, chrome, edge, safari) to be the place where a website begins. This has worked since the early days of the web and will do into the future of the internet!
