To begin development, run 
 >   <p> $npm i </p>
to run a local deployment for testing, run
 >   <p>$npm run dev </p>
The custom js that exists and has been built in the website will be brought in with git clone, but any new code will need to be built. If you have written new files, they will need to be added to the 
 >   <p>rollup-main.js </p>
file in order to get built.
Debug pointing files to 
 >   <p>src/js/</p>
and remember to point to 
 >   <p>src/build/</p>
 for deployment.
