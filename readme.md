Welcome back Megan! This repo uses 

- Typescript for type enforcement
- Express for server hosting
- Threejs for 3d rendering
- Lit for embedding components in html pages (mostly 3js here)
- Parcel for deployment

This repo requires node. Install it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download

To begin development, install dependencies with 
    `npm i`

Create a `parcel watch` to reflect code changes in a deployment with
    `npm run watch`

Then, in a separate terminal, run a local deployment for testing at localhost:3000 with
    `npm run dev`

The github actions automatically deploy to `meganbat.es` from any merges to main.
